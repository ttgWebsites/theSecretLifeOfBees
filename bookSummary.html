Growing up Lily lives alone with her father and an African American housekeeper, Rosaleen. Lily's father is abusive and rude; he treats Lily in no way that a father should. Lily's only motherly figure is her housekeeper Rosaleen, as her real mother died when she was young. After putting up with her father for years Lily runs away with Rosaleen in search of a better life. The two are taken in by a black woman, August Boatwright, and find themselves a new home and community. The Boatwright house provides Lily with many motherly figures and she learns femininity that she could have never have found living at home. Lily develops into a wonderful person with the help of the Boatwright house and she learns to put aside any prejudices she had against blacks as well. Lily manages to find love with a young black boy, Zach, and she puts aside her prejudices again for him. At the end of the novel Lily has finally developed enough strength to confront her father when he arrives at the Boatwright house to take her back home. Following their confrontation she is allowed to continue to live at the Boatwright's where she can live her life and continue to develop into an inspiring and wonderful woman.</li>
